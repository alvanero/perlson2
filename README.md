- **How do I play Perl?**
    
    Perl is a skill-based prediction game. Test your predictions skills and win $PERL for choosing correctly!
    
    We send out a daily cast for each new round on [@perl](https://warpcast.com/perl) as a Farcaster frame. 
    
    We also post rounds directly on [perl.xyz](http://perl.xyz) throughout the day (Pacific Standard Time).
    
    MORE / LESS game mode
    
    One caster will be chosen for each round along with a number and a social metric (likes, retweets, number of casts). Choose whether the caster will have MORE or LESS than than the number shown on the screen. 
    
    VERSUS game mode
    
    We pick two casters and a social metric for them to compete for (likes, recasts, number of casts). You pick which caster will get MORE than the other.
    
    Choose correctly and win $PERL based on the amount you wagered!
    
    **Social metrics are counted from a userâ€™s original casts.**
